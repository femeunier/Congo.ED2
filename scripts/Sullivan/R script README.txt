Code here reproduces Figs 1-4 and selected SI figures.

Notes - * Figures are produced using Fig1.R, Fig2.R, Fig3.R and Fig4.R scripts. The first three use the MultiCensusPlots and AllPlots files. Fig4.R uses rasters in the Raster outputs folder.
* Testing for interactions and breakpoints.R reproduces the delta AIC figures quoted in the paper.
* Code for scaling results to the biome are given by Scaling climate response.R and Propogate CO2 effects to biomass.R. These analyses were used to create the files in the Raster outputs folder.
Note that these scripts requires some external datafiles (e.g. biomass map) that are not provided in the data package. See scripts for details.
* Single census plot analysis.R, Fig S7_Analysis with random forests.R and Fig S8-11_Bivariate plots produce SI figures, and use the AllPlots and MultiCensusPlots files as input.
